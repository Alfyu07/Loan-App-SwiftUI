# iOS Mini Test Project - Loan Management App
This project is the result of completing a mini test provided.

## Getting Started
To run the project:

- Clone the repository:
 ``` 
 git clone https://github.com/Alfyu07/Loan-App-SwiftUI.git
 ```
 - Open the project in Xcode.
 - Build and run the project using Xcode.
## Approach
- I started by carefully reading the provided task requirements.
- Next, I checked the JSON output from the given API endpoint.
- I began the project by structuring the necessary models.
- Then, I designed the UI on paper before implementing it in code.

## Decision
For this mini project, I chose not to use any additional Swift libraries. This decision was made to allow evaluators to better assess my fundamental Swift skills.

I used SwiftUI with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern for this project. The reason for this choice is that I am proficient and comfortable with SwiftUI, also SwiftUI, combined with MVVM, provides a clear separation of concerns and a more reactive approach to building user interfaces, and also its align with my past experience.
